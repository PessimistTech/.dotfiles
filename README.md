# Dotfiles

This repo contains dotfiles for use across Homenet machines. 

To make use of these dotfiles use the install.sh script to install symlinks to these files so that they are updated when this repo is updated. 
The install script expects the location of this repo to be ~/gitlab/jwilson/dotfiles on macos, and have coreutils on linux (for relative paths).
